This directory contains the maps that will be used for the game.

The *.JPG files are the direct snippets from google maps. They will be ignored by the game program.
They are either normal maps, satellite or terrain maps.

The *.jpg files are derive from the *.JPG ones and come in different variants:
	- SQ: square maps. For a map of size 200 tiles -> 14x14 tiles
	- H: 4:3 ratio. For a map of size 200 tiles -> 12x16 tiles
	- V: 3:4 ratio. For a map of size 200 tiles -> 16x12 tiles

Feel free to add more yourself!
